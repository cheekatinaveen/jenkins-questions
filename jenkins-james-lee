1)How to change the admin password?

->Click on Admin at the top right hand side
->Click on configure
->In the password section , type the new password,confirm password
->Save


2)Explain Jenkins Architecture

Jenkins uses Master/Slave Architecture.It is distributed architecture.

Role of Master:-
Schedule build jobs
Dispatch builds to the slaves for the actual job execution
Monitor the slaves and build results
Can also execute build jobs directly.

Role of slave:-
Execute build jobs dispatched by master


3)What is the job/project ?

These two terms are used interchanageably.They all refer to runnable tasks that are controlled/monitored by Jenkins.

4)What are slave/node?

Slaves are computers that are setup to build projects for a master.
Jenkins runs a separate program called slave agent on slaves
When slave is registered to a master ,master starts distributing loads to slaves
Nodes is used to refer to all machines that are part of Jenkins grid,slaves and master.

5)What is executor?
Executor is a separate stream of builds to be run on a node in parallel.
A node can have one or more executors.


6)What is build?
Build is a result of one of the projects

7)What is plugins?
A plugin , like plugins on any other system,is a piece of software that extends the core functionality of the core Jenkins server.


8)Explain a brief overview of Manage Jenkins section?

It contains
->Configure system.Configure global settings and path like java ,maven path
->Configure Global Security.Secure Jenkins,define who is allowed to access/use the system.
->Manage Plugins.Helps to add,disable,enable plugins that can extend the functionality of Jenkins.
->System Information.Displays various environment information to assist trouble shooting.
->System Logs.It captures output from java.util.logging  output related to Jenkins.

9)How to create new job?
->Create new job
->Enter a item name
->Select Freestyle project
->Provide the project description
->You can check the Discard old builds  where you can provide the date and maxmium number of builds of you want to keep.
->Next section is SCM ,where you can define what repo you want to use.
->Buid can be either windows batch script,execute shell,invoke top level maven targets.
->Post build actions is mostly used to send out emails/notifications.


10)How to run a jenkins job?
Click on build scheduled , and if its blue ball , its a success.


11)How to setup a Maven based build job?
->Check out source code from GitHub
->Complie the code
->Run the test
->Package the application

12)How to install Github Plugin?

->Go to Manage Jenkins
->Manage Plugins
->Filter it by searching for github plugin
->click on install withhout restart

13)What does Maven do ?

Maven describes how the software is built
Maven describes the project dependencies.

14)How to configure JDk,Maven and Git in Jenkins?
->Go to Manage Jenkins section
->Global Tools Configuration
->Provide the git,maven and JDK path and save it

15)How does pom.xml describe?
->Describe the software project being built ,including
dependences on other external modules
directory structures
required plugins
The predefined tasks for performing certain tasks such as compliation and packaging.

16)How to create the Maven project ?
->New Item
->Provide a name and select freestyle project
->Provide the source code repo,i.e GIT
->provide the mvn goals, clean package


17)How to do maven project in Jenkins?
Check for the console output, first git logs, then maven goals, then creating .jar file


18)How to automatically build in Jenkins?
Using Polling SCM which makes sure that whenever a code is committed it will  pull from github.

19)How to make sure that every time the user/password is not asked?
->Setup SSH keys for GitHub account
->SSH Keys are ways to identify trusted computers without involving password
->Generate SSH key pair and save the private SSH key in your local box and add the public key to your GithHub account
->Then you can directly push changes  to github repository without typing password

Create ssh-keygen
then add the private key to local and add public to github repo.



19)What are the different build triggers?
->Poll SCM
->Build Periodically
->Build after other projects are built
->Build when a change is pushed to github

20)How to generate code quality and code coverage metrics report?
Using Checkstyle

Checkstyle is a code static analysis tool to help programmers to write Java code that adheres to a coding standard 

Go to the project, click on configure ,add checkstyle:checkstyle in Maven goals section , also select , publish checkstyle analysis results.


21)How to archive artifacts?
Go to project page, configure section, ego to post build artifacts and add **/*.war and save it, and then rerun the jenkins job and could see build artifacts getting saved.

22)How to install and configure apache tomcat ?
->Go to apache tomact page , go to tomcat8 downloads, download it , unzip the file, change the port to 8090 , which you will find in /conf/server/xml file.
->Also make sure you provide permissions to startup scripts , use chmod for this
->also provide a definitive roles to configure jenkins with tomcat,modify users and roles.
->Stop tomcat using shutdown script and start it back using startup scripts which will be in the bin folder.

23)How to trigger current project upon the success of other project?
Suppose you need to make sure that if your build is a success in DEV environment , then you want it to automatically deploy to QA, then 
->Install copy artifact and deploy to container plugins
->Create a new project,sue freestyle
->Go to build step , use  copy artifacts from other project.Provide the package name,artifacts to copy
->Go to post build actions,seelct deploy war/ear to a container.In The war/ear section provide **/*.war
->Click on add containers,select tomcat 7.x,provide user/pass,and tomcat url
->Now to go to the package project,go to post build action ,build other projects,trigger only if build is stable



24)Explain Jenkins build pipeline?
->Install the build pipeline plugins
->click on view and create a new view
->Click on Build pipeline to see all the changes, if there is any upstream and downstream changes.
->Click on run and it will trigger

25)How to do parallel Jenkins build ?
->Remove checkstyle:checkstyle goals
->Create new item, give a new job a name" Static Analaysis" . select Freestyle
->in SCM , use git and put the url
->Move down to build section, invoke top-level maven project, in goals, we use checkstyle
->Now to original package job and go to post build actions, and add static analysis list and save.


26)How to deploy to production?
Create a copy of current tomcat file, and then change the port to 9090
->then create a new build other projects(manual section) and trigger it


27)What are the different ways to start the agent?
->The master can start the slave agents via SSH
->Start the slave agent manually using Java Web Start
->Install the slave agent as a windows service
->Start the slave agent directly from command line on the slave machine
